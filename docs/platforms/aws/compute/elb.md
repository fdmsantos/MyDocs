## Monitoring

* ActiveConnectionCount
* HealthyHostCount, UnHealthyHostCount, HostCount
* BackendConnectionErrors
    - The count of the number of connections that were NOT successfully established between the Load Balancer and the registered instance
    - Average stat is most useful
    - Will report errors for all AZ's
    - Could indicate an issue with the web server
* HTTPCode_Backend_2XX,3XX,4XX,5XX
    - Generated by registered instances
* HTTPCode_ELB_4XX,5XX
    - Generated by Load Balancer
* ActiveFlowCount (Network Load Balancer)
* Metrics for performance
    - Latency
        - Measures the time elapsed (in seconds) after the request leaves the Load Balancer until the response is received
        - Average stat is most useful
        - Will report latency for all AZs
        - Page Load Time
    - RequestCount
        - Number of requests completed/connections made during specified interval (1 or 5 mins)
    - SurgeQueueLenght (Classic only)
        - A count of the total number of requests that are pending submissions to a registered instance
        - Max queue size is 1024
        - Additional requests will be rejected
        - Scaling up instances to ensure that never increases beyond the maximum queue capacity
    - SpilloverCount (Classic only)
        - Number of requests rejected because the surge queue is full
        - Direct consequence of a surge queue length increase
        - Should monitor SpilloverCount and SurgeQueueLenght
    - High numbers in these metrics can indicate a performance issue, need to scale infrastructure, etc
